5 Steps to Improving IT Resiliency  
Improving MySQL Performance: 3 Tips
Today almost every open source web app employs MySQL because it is compatible with all hosting providers and is extremely easy to use. But if your eCommerce website or web application performs poorly, here’s what you need to do:

1.    Performance Tuning
Fine tune your HAProxy instances to improve the performance of your web application. Optimize your database and speed up your server with an advanced load balancing software. A database load balancing software is designed to deliver the agility and scalability needed to expand capabilities and meet both unplanned and anticipated performance demands.

2.    Security Audits
DoS attacks and spamming can wreck havoc on your database server. You can easily prevent performance issues and increase uptime with a robust load balancing software that ensures automatic failover and security updates.

3.    Optimizing Queries
When websites and applications are poorly coded, no database optimization tools and techniques will come in handy when fixing the server load. SQL server load balancing software is a one-stop solution for maintaining uptime, data consistency, increasing performance, reducing service costs, and ensuring continuous availability for an enhanced customer experience. It does everything from running health checks and maintaining high performance to lowering the query wait time and enabling even distribution of load across multiple servers.
